    "- Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "- Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "- Hierarchical labeling of axes\n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files, Excel files, databases, and HDF5\n",
