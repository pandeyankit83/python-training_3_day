    "## What Is There to Manage?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python Distribution makes life a little easier when getting started with Python as it comes preconfigured with many of the most popular Python packages for data analysis. However, you will come to a point where a package you'd like to use is not included and so you will have to download and install it. Furthermore the packages you use will continue to develop and include new features over time, which will require you to update your packages. All of this, and more, is broadly defined as **package management** and there are tools to make it a simple task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda Install\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python Distribution has its own package manager called **conda**. The complete documentation available within the [Conda User Guide: Managing Packages](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html), and we will review some of the key commands below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is important to note that you will be running these commands within the **terminal or Anaconda Prompt***\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is a concept of 'environments' within Python, which is a way to have different versions of Python and associated packages all on the same machine. We will skip this for now, but it is mentioned because if you maintain different environments then you will want to specify which environment you are managing. If this is something you want to explore then the [Conda User Guide: Managing Environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) is a good place to start.\n",

    "\n",
    "API stands for \"Application Programming Interface\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a module gives you access to functions, objects, and methods that someone else has built an API will give you access to functions, objects, and methods that are specific to a certain program.\n",

    "An example of an API is an ATM. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the ATM functionality (e.g. set balance number) cannot be accessed by the public. The only way to interact with an ATM is through a set of pre-defined functions that allow you to perform certain allowed actions (e.g. 'deposit money', 'withdrawal money').\n",
    "\n",
    "The same goes for programs with APIs they allow you to access certain functions or information via Python without giving you full access to all of the \"under the hood\" functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should I care about APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you combine Python with an API you are able to take advantage of the things that make Python so great (e.g. clean code, simple easy to understand syntax, ability to build scripts quickly) while accessing advanced functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some examples of some APIs that have been explored at  . This is by no means an exhaustive list of APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Google has huge API library that will allow to access a lot of Google apps via Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geopy + Google Maps (or other Geocoding APIs)\n",
    "* Can be used to convert addresses to longitude / latitude values \n",
