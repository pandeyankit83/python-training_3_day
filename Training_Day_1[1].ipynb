    "|------|-------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n",

    "## Lists\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "* Lists are ordered collections of objects\n",
    " * List order is by default, defined by the order that items get added to the list not the value of the items\n",
    " * Lists can contain multiple data types\n",
    " * ``['string', 1, 1.024, True]`` <- all of these can fit into one list\n",

    " * Any existing index can be updated\n",
    "* When building a Python list you do not need to declare the lists' size\n",
    "* Python lists point to a specific address in memory where objects are stored\n",
    " * If you set a variable equal to a list, even if it has a different name it will point to the same memory location meaning that modifying the original list or new variable will modify both.\n",
    " * You can always check the unique memory location of an object using the id function `id(object)`\n",
    " \n",
    "### List Syntax\n",
    "* In python lists can be created from scratch by wrapping your objects in brackets []\n",
